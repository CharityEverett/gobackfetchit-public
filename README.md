# Go Back Fetch It

This project was one of the first AR storytelling experiences created, started back in 2017 and won the 2019 Rising Star Prize Award from the Virtual World Society at the Augmented World Expo. It is a data storytelling project that mixes anthropology, geography, culture, and New Media Technology, graciously supported by the Open Documentary Lab at MIT, the Cambridge Arts Council, the Mass Cultural Council, and the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard.
